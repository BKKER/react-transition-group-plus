# React Transition Group Plus

Forked from React's [ReactTransitionGroup](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/src/addons/transitions/ReactTransitionGroup.js)

Drop-in replacement for ReactTransitionGroup that will allow scheduling entrance animations to happen before or after outgoing animations, and add cancel hooks so interactions aren't stuck until the animations are done. 

Inspired by [Vue's transition](http://vuejs.org/guide/transitions.html#JavaScript_Transitions).
